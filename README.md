# Nucleation of the destruction complex on the centrosome accelerates degradation of Î²-catenin and regulates Wnt signal transmission (2022)
Welcome to the repository. Follow the instructions to set up Docker, Paraview, and the program. 
The program is currently made to match the results of nucleation on the centrosome, in order to simulate the conditions without a nucleator, change the nucleator density
value to zero.
